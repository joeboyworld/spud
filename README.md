This app is designed for personal use to monitor incoming emails and automatically draft potential replies. By generating initial comments or responses, the app helps speed up email management; however, the user remains in full control. Drafts can be reviewed, edited, and finalised at any time before being sent, ensuring that automated content is always subject to human oversight.
